# About the IdiotStudios API

The **IdiotStudios API** is the official backend service powering IdiotStudios projects and tools. It provides access to various resources, such as projects, and more.

This documentation is designed for developers who want to integrate IdiotStudios services into their own applications or explore how the API works.

## Base URL

All requests are made relative to:

``` html
https://api.idiotstudios.co.za/
```

## Authentication

Currently, most public endpoints do **not** require authentication. However, some endpoints do and are either private and unavailable in the public API or require an API for telling user requests apart.

## Available Endpoints

This documentation is split into multiple sections:

* [Root](./root) – General base endpoint
* [Auth](./auth/about) – The Auth endpoint
